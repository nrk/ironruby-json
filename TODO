 * ParserEngine and ParserEngineState need a rework, the JSON_parse_* methods 
   are not so object oriented.

 * Check if the code removed in JSON#generator= (common.rb) could break the 
   "pure" variant of this library.

 * Create ParserEngine.rl to auto-generate the C# code using Ragel.

 * Code needs more comments.
