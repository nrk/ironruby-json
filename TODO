 * There is a bug when throwing exceptions from within C# (exceptions do not 
   have the right message string and have no backtrace).

 * ParserEngine and ParserEngineState need a rework, the JSON_parse_* methods 
   are not so object oriented.

 * Tests, tests, tests. Seriously, they are needed.

 * Check if the code removed in JSON#generator= (common.rb) could break the 
   "pure" variant of this library.

 * I still have to create ParserEngine.rl to auto-generate the C# code using 
   Ragel.

 * Code needs more comments
